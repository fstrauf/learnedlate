# 15+ Business Process Automation Examples (Real Companies, Real Results)

You know automation works. The question is: where do you actually start?

Most business process automation guides throw around buzzwords like "digital transformation" without showing you what real companies actually automated. This article does the opposite. You'll see 15+ concrete examples from real businesses, complete with before/after metrics, implementation details, and honest ROI numbers.

Let's skip the theory and jump straight into what's working. For a strategic approach to automation, see our [AI strategy for small business: 90-day action plan](./2025-06-22-ai-strategy-small-business-90-day-action-plan.md).

## What Counts as Business Process Automation?

Before we dive into examples, let's ground ourselves. Business process automation means using software to handle repetitive tasks that humans currently do manually. 

It's not about replacing people—it's about freeing them from tedious work so they can focus on tasks that actually move the needle.

**Three types of automation you'll see in this article:**

1. **Task automation**: Single repetitive actions (data entry, email responses)
2. **Workflow automation**: Multi-step processes (customer onboarding, invoice processing)
3. **Decision automation**: Rule-based decisions (lead scoring, inventory reordering)

Now let's look at how real businesses implement these.

## Sales & Marketing Automation Examples

## How to Choose Your First Automation Project

You've seen what's possible. Now, where should *you* start?

**Use this framework:**

### 1. Map Your Repetitive Processes

Spend one week tracking tasks that:
- Happen more than once per week
- Follow the same steps every time
- Don't require complex human judgment
- Cause bottlenecks or frustration

### 2. Calculate the "Automation Score"

For each process, score 1-10 on:
- **Frequency**: How often it happens
- **Time cost**: Hours spent weekly
- **Error rate**: How often mistakes occur
- **Ease**: How straightforward to automate

Multiply these together. Highest score = your first target.

### 3. Estimate ROI

**Time saved annually** (hours) × **hourly cost** (salary + overhead) = **annual benefit**

Compare to:
- Tool costs (monthly × 12)
- Setup costs (consulting, implementation time)
- Training time

If payback period is under 12 months, it's probably worth it.

### 4. Start Small

Don't automate your entire business at once. Pick one process. Get it working. Learn. Then expand.

The companies in this article didn't transform overnight. They automated one workflow, measured results, and built momentum.

## Common Automation Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't automate broken processes.** Fix the process first, then automate it. Automation amplifies—if your process is inefficient, you'll just do inefficient things faster.

**Don't over-engineer.** The best automation is often the simplest. A Zapier workflow connecting two tools beats a custom-coded solution that takes 3 months to build.

**Don't forget the humans.** Some processes *should* stay manual. Customer conversations that build relationships, creative strategy work, complex problem-solving—these aren't automation candidates.

**Don't set and forget.** Automation needs maintenance. Tools change, processes evolve, edge cases appear. Review your automations quarterly.

## Tools Mentioned in This Article

Most examples used combinations of:
- **Workflow automation**: Zapier, Make (Integromat), n8n
- **Email/CRM**: ActiveCampaign, HubSpot, Salesforce
