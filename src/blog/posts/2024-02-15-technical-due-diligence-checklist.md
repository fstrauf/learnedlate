# Technical Due Diligence Checklist for Investors

Technical due diligence is a critical component of investment decision-making, yet it's often rushed or inadequately performed. A thorough technical assessment can reveal hidden risks, validate growth potential, and inform valuation decisions. Here's a comprehensive checklist I use when conducting technical due diligence for investors.

## Why Technical Due Diligence Matters

Poor technical foundations can sink even the most promising businesses. I've seen companies lose millions due to security breaches, suffer major outages from scalability issues, and hemorrhage talent because of technical debt. A proper technical assessment helps investors:

- Identify potential technical risks and liabilities
- Assess the scalability of current systems
- Evaluate the technical team's capabilities
- Understand infrastructure and operational costs
- Validate technical claims made in pitch decks

## Pre-Assessment Preparation

Before diving into the technical details, establish the scope and gather essential information:

### Information Request List
- System architecture diagrams
- Technology stack documentation
- Code repository access (with appropriate NDAs)
- Infrastructure and hosting details
- Security policies and procedures
- Development team organizational chart
- Recent performance metrics and monitoring data

### Time Allocation
- **Initial Review**: 2-3 days for documentation and high-level assessment
- **Deep Dive**: 3-5 days for code review and architecture analysis
- **Team Interviews**: 1-2 days for technical team discussions
- **Report Preparation**: 1-2 days for findings compilation

## Technical Architecture Assessment

### System Design Evaluation
**Scalability Architecture**
- Can the system handle 10x current load?
- Are there obvious bottlenecks in the architecture?
- How is data partitioned and distributed?
- What's the disaster recovery plan?

**Technology Stack Modernity**
- Are they using current, well-supported technologies?
- Is the stack appropriate for their use case?
- How many different technologies are in play?
- Are there any deprecated or end-of-life dependencies?

**API Design Quality**
- RESTful design principles followed?
- Proper versioning strategy in place?
- Rate limiting and security measures implemented?
- Documentation quality and completeness?

### Infrastructure & DevOps
**Cloud Strategy**
- Multi-cloud or single provider dependency?
- Auto-scaling capabilities implemented?
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices?
- Cost optimization strategies in place?

**Deployment Pipeline**
- Automated testing coverage percentage?
- Continuous integration/deployment setup?
- Rollback capabilities and procedures?
- Environment parity (dev/staging/production)?

**Monitoring & Observability**
- Application performance monitoring tools?
- Log aggregation and analysis systems?
- Alert systems and escalation procedures?
- Business metrics tracking beyond technical metrics?

## Code Quality Assessment

### Code Review Process
**Development Practices**
- Code review process and enforcement?
- Coding standards and style guides?
- Version control workflow (Git flow, etc.)?
- Documentation standards for code and APIs?

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit test coverage percentage?
- Integration and end-to-end testing?
- Performance and load testing procedures?
- Security testing and vulnerability scanning?

**Technical Debt Analysis**
- Code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, etc.)?
- Legacy code percentage and refactoring plans?
- Dependency management and update policies?
- Performance optimization history and plans?

### Security Assessment

**Application Security**
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities addressed?
- Input validation and sanitization practices?
- Authentication and authorization implementation?
- Data encryption at rest and in transit?

**Infrastructure Security**
- Network security and firewall configurations?
- Access control and privilege management?
- Security incident response procedures?
- Compliance with relevant standards (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)?

**Data Protection**
- Personal data handling and privacy compliance?
- Data backup and recovery procedures?
- Third-party data sharing agreements?
- Data retention and deletion policies?

## Team & Process Evaluation

### Technical Team Assessment
**Team Composition**
- Senior to junior developer ratio?
- Full-stack vs. specialized skill distribution?
- Key person dependency risks?
- Hiring plans and talent acquisition strategy?

**Team Capabilities**
- Experience with current technology stack?
- Track record of delivering complex projects?
- Open source contributions and community involvement?
- Learning and development culture?

**Leadership Evaluation**
- CTO/Tech Lead experience and background?
- Technical decision-making process?
- Ability to scale team and processes?
- Vision for technical roadmap alignment with business goals?

### Development Processes
**Project Management**
- Agile/Scrum implementation effectiveness?
- Sprint planning and execution consistency?
- Stakeholder communication processes?
- Feature prioritization and roadmap management?

**Quality Assurance**
- Bug tracking and resolution processes?
- User acceptance testing procedures?
- Production issue response times?
- Post-mortem and learning culture?

## Performance & Scalability Analysis

### Current Performance Metrics
**System Performance**
- Average response times and latency?
- Throughput and concurrent user capacity?
- Database query performance and optimization?
- Third-party service dependencies and SLAs?

**Growth Preparation**
- Capacity planning and forecasting?
- Database scaling strategy (vertical vs. horizontal)?
- CDN and caching implementation?
- Microservices vs. monolith architecture decisions?

## Risk Assessment Framework

### High-Risk Red Flags
- **Single Point of Failure**: Critical systems with no redundancy
- **Key Person Dependency**: Only one person understands critical systems
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Unpatched systems or poor security practices
- **Technical Debt**: Significant legacy code with no refactoring plan
- **Scalability Walls**: Architecture that can't handle projected growth

### Medium-Risk Yellow Flags
- **Outdated Technology**: Using older but stable technology versions
- **Limited Testing**: Basic testing but gaps in coverage
- **Manual Processes**: Some automation but manual bottlenecks remain
- **Team Scaling**: Growing team but processes not fully mature

### Low-Risk Green Flags
- **Modern Architecture**: Well-designed, scalable system architecture
- **Strong Team**: Experienced team with good practices
- **Comprehensive Testing**: High test coverage and automated quality gates
- **Security-First**: Proactive security measures and compliance
- **Monitoring Excellence**: Comprehensive observability and alerting

## Financial Implications

### Technical Debt Costs
Estimate the cost of addressing identified technical debt:
- Developer time required for refactoring
- Infrastructure upgrades needed for scaling
- Security improvements and compliance costs
- Team scaling and training expenses

### Operational Efficiency
Assess ongoing technical operational costs:
- Cloud infrastructure spending optimization opportunities
- Development velocity improvements possible
- Support and maintenance burden reduction
- Automation ROI potential

## Recommendations Framework

### Immediate Actions (0-3 months)
- Critical security vulnerabilities to address
- Single points of failure to eliminate
- Essential monitoring and alerting to implement
- Key documentation to create or update

### Short-term Improvements (3-12 months)
- Technical debt reduction priorities
- Team scaling and process improvements
- Infrastructure optimization opportunities
- Development velocity enhancements

### Long-term Strategic Items (12+ months)
- Architecture evolution plans
- Technology stack modernization
- Advanced scalability preparations
- Innovation and competitive advantage initiatives

## Conclusion

Technical due diligence is both an art and a science. While this checklist provides a comprehensive framework, the key is adapting the assessment to the specific company, industry, and investment thesis. Remember that perfect technical systems don't existâ€”the goal is to understand risks, validate capabilities, and ensure the technical foundation can support the business's growth trajectory.

A thorough technical assessment takes time and expertise, but it's an investment that can save millions and provide confidence in your investment decision. Don't skip it, and don't rush it.
