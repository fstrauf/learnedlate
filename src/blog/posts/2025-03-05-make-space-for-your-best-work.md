### Make Space for Your Best Work

Maximize productive work to create more free time for personal interests like spending time with family, surfing, or reading. Here are five proven strategies to make space for your best work.

**Essential Strategies:**

* **Block Distractions:** Use tools like Cold Turkey to block distracting websites and apps during work hours. Remove temptations like snacks from your workspace - DON'T BUY SNACKS.

* **Speak Instead of Type:** Use voice-to-text tools like ChatGPT or Superwhisper to increase efficiency, write prompts and articles faster, and work while multitasking.

* **Manage Curiosity:** Follow curiosity immediately when it strikes. Keep quick note-taking tools like Apple Reminders and Obsidian open to capture ideas before excitement fades.

* **Create Mental Space:** Take walks without devices. Allow your brain quiet time to reflect - new ideas appear automatically during downtime.

* **Prioritize Peak Hours:** Track your energy levels throughout the day. Do deep work during your most focused times and match tasks to your natural energy rhythms.

The goal is creating more space for what matters most while maintaining high productivity standards.
