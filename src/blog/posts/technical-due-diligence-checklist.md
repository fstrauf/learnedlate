# Technical Due Diligence Checklist for Startup Investors

Your $500K investment decision shouldn't hinge on a founder's PowerPoint deck.

While financial due diligence gets all the attention, technical due diligence often determines whether a startup can actually deliver on its promises. Yet most investors skip the technical assessment or delegate it to someone who's never built a scalable system.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: 70% of startup failures stem from technical issues that could have been identified in a proper due diligence process.

This guide gives you a practical framework for technical assessment that works whether you're evaluating a pre-revenue MVP or a Series A candidate with enterprise customers.

## Why Technical Due Diligence Matters More Now

### The AI Revolution Changes Everything
Traditional software assessments focus on code quality and architecture. Today's successful startups integrate AI at their core, creating new categories of technical risk and opportunity.

A startup claiming "AI-powered" features needs different evaluation criteria than a traditional SaaS business.

### Cloud Infrastructure Complexity
Modern startups deploy across multiple cloud providers, use dozens of third-party APIs, and manage complex data pipelines. Each integration point represents both capability and risk.

### Open Source Dependencies
The average startup depends on 500+ open source packages. One critical security vulnerability in a core dependency can shut down operations overnight.

### Regulatory Complexity
From GDPR to SOC2 to industry-specific compliance requirements, technical architecture decisions have immediate legal and business implications.

## The 48-Hour Assessment Framework

Most investment decisions operate on compressed timelines. This framework provides comprehensive technical evaluation within 48 hours.

### Hour 1-4: Initial Technical Interview

**Meeting Participants:**
- Founder/CEO (business context)
- CTO or technical lead (architecture decisions)
- Lead developer (implementation details)
- Optional: DevOps lead (infrastructure)

**Key Questions:**
1. "Walk me through your architecture from user request to database and back."
2. "What's your current biggest technical challenge?"
3. "If you had to rebuild from scratch, what would you do differently?"
4. "How do you handle data backup and disaster recovery?"
5. "What happens when a key developer leaves?"

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Inability to explain architecture clearly
- Overcomplication for current scale
- No backup or disaster recovery plan
- Single points of failure in team or technology
- Dismissive attitude toward security or compliance

### Hour 5-12: Documentation Review

**Essential Documents to Request:**
- System architecture diagrams
- Database schema documentation
- API documentation
- Infrastructure and deployment procedures
- Security and compliance documentation
- Code review processes and standards

**What You're Evaluating:**
- **Documentation Quality:** Well-documented systems indicate mature development practices
- **Architecture Clarity:** Clear diagrams suggest thoughtful design decisions
- **Process Maturity:** Documented procedures indicate scalable operations
- **Security Awareness:** Proper security documentation shows risk management

**Green Flags:**
- Clear, up-to-date architecture documentation

**Red Flags:**
- Outdated or missing documentation
- Overly complex architecture for current scale
- No security or compliance documentation
- Ad-hoc processes without documentation
- Architecture that doesn't match claimed capabilities

### Hour 13-24: Technical Deep Dive

**Code Quality Assessment:**

## Conclusion: Technical Due Diligence as Competitive Advantage

Most investors focus on market size and business model while treating technology as a black box. This creates opportunity for investors who understand technical risk and opportunity.

Technical due diligence isn't just about avoiding bad investments. It's about identifying technical advantages that create sustainable competitive moats.

The startups that win don't just solve customer problems—they solve them in ways that are technically difficult for competitors to replicate.

Your 48 hours of technical due diligence might be the difference between funding the next unicorn and watching it get funded by someone else who recognized the technical opportunity you missed.
