# Custom Software Development Packages for NZ Small Business

The biggest barrier to custom software adoption isn't technical complexityâ€”it's pricing uncertainty. Traditional custom development comes with vague estimates, scope creep, and budget surprises.

AI-accelerated development changes this entirely. We can now offer fixed-price packages with predictable outcomes, making custom software as accessible as any other business investment.

## The Problem with Traditional Custom Software Pricing

### Why Most Quotes Are Unreliable:
- **Scope uncertainty:** Requirements evolve during development
- **Integration complexity:** Existing systems more complex than expected
- **Feature creep:** "Quick additions" compound into major changes
- **Technical debt:** Poor architecture decisions create expensive rework

### The Result:
- 50% of projects exceed original budgets
- 40% require significant scope changes
- 30% take twice as long as estimated
- 15% are abandoned before completion

## AI-Accelerated Development: Predictable Packages

With AI tools handling code generation, testing, and architecture optimization, we can deliver custom software with the predictability of off-the-shelf solutions.

### The Fixed-Price Advantage:
- **No scope creep:** Comprehensive requirements analysis upfront
- **No surprise costs:** All complexity identified during feasibility phase
- **No timeline uncertainty:** AI-assisted project management with accurate predictions
- **No technical debt:** AI-powered code review ensures quality architecture
