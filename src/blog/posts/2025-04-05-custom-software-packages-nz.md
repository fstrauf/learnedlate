# Custom Software Development Packages for NZ Small Business

The biggest barrier to custom software adoption isn't technical complexity—it's pricing uncertainty. Traditional custom development comes with vague estimates, scope creep, and budget surprises.

AI-accelerated development changes this entirely. We can now offer fixed-price packages with predictable outcomes, making custom software as accessible as any other business investment.

## The Problem with Traditional Custom Software Pricing

### Why Most Quotes Are Unreliable:
- **Scope uncertainty:** Requirements evolve during development
- **Integration complexity:** Existing systems more complex than expected
- **Feature creep:** "Quick additions" compound into major changes
- **Technical debt:** Poor architecture decisions create expensive rework

### The Result:
- 50% of projects exceed original budgets
- 40% require significant scope changes
- 30% take twice as long as estimated
- 15% are abandoned before completion

## AI-Accelerated Development: Predictable Packages

With AI tools handling code generation, testing, and architecture optimization, we can deliver custom software with the predictability of off-the-shelf solutions.

### The Fixed-Price Advantage:
- **No scope creep:** Comprehensive requirements analysis upfront
- **No surprise costs:** All complexity identified during feasibility phase
- **No timeline uncertainty:** AI-assisted project management with accurate predictions
- **No technical debt:** AI-powered code review ensures quality architecture
