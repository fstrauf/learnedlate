### The Good Enough Mindset

The "good enough mindset" is about finding functional solutions without chasing perfection. Good enough means you get something to work even though the solution might not be perfect. This approach focuses on getting working solutions faster and cheaper.

**Core Principles:**

* **Break Down Problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable chunks
* **Prioritize Function:** Focus on getting something that works over creating a perfect solution
* **Consider Static Solutions:** Use static solutions instead of fully dynamic ones when possible
* **Follow the Pareto Principle:** 20% effort gets 80% of the solution

**Important Distinctions:**

Good enough does NOT mean cutting corners. The goal is to build something that works while keeping the perfect solution in mind for future iterations. Perfecting the final 20% often requires 80% more effort.

**Practical Applications:**

Especially useful in startup environments with time and budget constraints. Helps quickly deliver features to customers and maintain development momentum.

**Caveat:** This approach doesn't apply to all situations. Some scenarios still require perfect solutions. Be aware of potential technical debt.
