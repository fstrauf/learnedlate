"What does a CTO actually do?"

The answer changes dramatically depending on your stage. A CTO at a pre-product startup does something completely different than a CTO at a scaling company with 50 engineers.

Most founders get confused because they expect the CTO to do everything: write code, hire engineers, set strategy, fix servers, train the team. 

That's not realistic. At different stages, the CTO focuses on different things.

Here's what actually matters at each stage.

## Pre-Product Stage (Validating the idea)

**Your situation:**
- You have an idea and maybe a co-founder
- You might have customer conversations but no revenue
- You probably don't have a team yet
- You have 3-6 months of runway

**What the CTO does:**
- **Builds the MVP** (writes a lot of code)
- **Validates technical feasibility** (can this actually be built?)
- **Makes technology choices** (language, framework, architecture)
- **Handles infrastructure** (hosting, databases, deployment)
- **Owns all tech decisions** (there's no "other engineer" to discuss with)

**The CTO's focus:** Speed and learning, not perfection.

You're trying to validate the business model. Technical decisions should enable that, not slow it down.

**Time breakdown:** 80% coding, 15% learning/research, 5% strategy

**CTO profile:** Usually a technical co-founder or early employee. Could be external fractional CTO but they need to write code.

**Biggest mistake:** Over-engineering the MVP. You don't need a perfect architecture. You need something that works fast enough to learn from customers.

**Success metric:** Product ships and you learn something from users.

## MVP to Product-Market Fit (0-12 months post-launch)

**Your situation:**
- You have a product and some early customers
- Maybe 1-2 other engineers on the team
- You're making constant changes based on feedback
- You're trying to find what resonates with customers

**What the CTO does:**
- **Still writes code** (actively contributing, maybe 50% of their time)
- **Leads technical direction** (architecture decisions, tech choices)
- **Mentors other engineers** (helping junior devs level up)
- **Defines development process** (how the team ships code safely)
- **Owns production** (if something breaks, it's on you)
- **Manages technical debt** (balancing speed with maintainability)

**The CTO's focus:** Building a scalable foundation while moving fast.

You're figuring out what your business is. Technical decisions should support rapid iteration without creating unmaintainable code.

**Time breakdown:** 40% coding, 30% leadership/mentorship, 20% architecture/tech decisions, 10% operations

**CTO profile:** Someone who can code and lead. Fractional CTO works here if experienced.

**Biggest mistake:** Optimizing prematurely. "We need to rewrite this in Rust" when you're still finding product-market fit. Also: writing code that's unmaintainable and becomes a liability when you hire more engineers.

**Success metric:** The team ships regularly. Code quality is good enough that new engineers don't despair. You have a technical roadmap that aligns with business roadmap.

## Growth Stage (Post-PMF, building team, 3-30 engineers)

**Your situation:**
- You've found product-market fit
- You're hiring engineers (fast)
- Your technology needs are getting more complex
- You're scaling the team and processes
- You have 12+ months of runway

**What the CTO does:**
- **Writes less code** (maybe 20-30% of their time)
- **Builds the team** (hiring, onboarding, culture)
- **Defines technical strategy** (roadmap, architecture, technology decisions)
- **Manages technical debt** (deciding when to refactor vs. ship)
- **Represents technical needs to business** (what can we actually deliver?)
- **Builds process and quality** (code review, testing, deployment)
- **Owns hiring and retention** (attracting engineers, keeping them happy)

**The CTO's focus:** Building a scalable team and systems.

At this stage, code quality matters because you're going to have 10+ engineers building on top of it. You also need to retain people and have clear technical direction.

**Time breakdown:** 30% leadership/mentorship, 25% hiring/team building, 20% technical strategy, 15% architecture, 10% hands-on coding

**CTO profile:** Someone who enjoys leadership and team building. Doesn't have to write code daily but needs to understand what's happening technically. Fractional CTO transitions to full-time here (or brought on full-time).

**Biggest mistakes:**
- Trying to do all the coding yourself (you become a bottleneck)
- Not investing in process and quality early (it explodes when you scale to 20+ engineers)
- Hiring wrong engineers (one bad hire slows down the whole team)
- Not communicating technical constraints to the business (teams commit to things that aren't feasible)

**Success metrics:**
- You're hiring good engineers and they stay
- Code quality and deployment speed are high
- Technical roadmap aligns with business roadmap
- Team morale is good
- You're shipping regularly without bugs dominating the work

## Scale Stage (Scaling beyond one team, 30+ engineers)

**Your situation:**
- You have multiple teams working on different components
- Technology complexity is high
- You need to manage technical debt at scale
- You're hiring for specific roles (platform team, infrastructure, etc.)
- Your business model is working and you're scaling revenue

**What the CTO does:**
- **Almost no code** (maybe 5-10% or tactical deep dives)
- **Leads technical strategy** (big architectural decisions)
- **Manages multiple teams** (each with their own lead engineer/manager)
- **Owns technical roadmap** (aligned with business strategy)
- **Decides on technology choices** (new languages, frameworks, infrastructure)
- **Manages performance and culture** (building technical culture)
- **Represents tech to C-suite** (connecting technical decisions to business outcomes)
- **Handles partnerships and compliance** (security, integration partners)
- **Plans for the next phase** (IPO readiness, scale challenges, etc.)

**The CTO's focus:** Strategic leadership and organizational design.

At this scale, your job is making good big decisions and creating an environment where smart engineers make good decisions too.

**Time breakdown:** 40% team leadership/management, 25% strategic planning, 15% meetings/partnerships, 10% hands-on technical depth, 10% culture/hiring

**CTO profile:** Someone who's managed large technical organizations. Probably someone external if you don't have this experience. Full-time only (this is a full-time job).

**Biggest mistakes:**
- Trying to know everything that's happening technically (you can't; delegate)
- Making technical decisions without consulting teams (they'll implement them poorly if they're not bought in)
- Not investing in tools and infrastructure (compounding debt explodes at this scale)
- Letting culture slide (good engineers leave when culture goes bad)

**Success metrics:**
- Engineers feel like they understand technical direction
- Teams ship mostly on schedule
- Major incidents are rare
- Hiring and retention are strong
- You're attracting senior engineers

## The CTO's Responsibilities by Dimension

Use this table to understand what matters at your stage:

| Responsibility | Pre-Product | MVP | Growth | Scale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Writing Code** | 80% | 40% | 20% | 5% |

| **Team Leadership** | 5% | 25% | 35% | 40% |
| **Hiring** | 5% | 10% | 20% | 15% |
| **Strategic Planning** | 0% | 10% | 15% | 20% |
| **Operations/Tools** | 0% | 0% | 10% | 15% |

## Common CTO Failures

**The code-only CTO**
- Writes great code but won't mentor
- Can't scale beyond their own capacity
- Becomes a bottleneck
- Team doesn't improve
- Problem: Doesn't evolve from pre-product CTO role

**The disconnected strategist**
- Makes architectural decisions without understanding what teams are actually dealing with
- Becomes out of touch
- Teams don't respect the vision
- Problem: Doesn't stay involved enough to make good decisions

**The absent executive**
- Delegates all decisions, never gets involved
- Teams make suboptimal decisions
- Technical debt compounds
- Problem: No technical leadership when it matters

**The perfectionist**
- Insists on perfect code at startup speed
- Slows down the team
- Creates friction with business
- Problem: Doesn't understand trade-offs required at each stage

## What CTO Actually Means

Here's the thing: "CTO" is a title that means wildly different things at different companies.

At some startups, CTO means "the most senior engineer." At others, it means "head of engineering." At others, it means "technology strategist who also manages vendors."

Before you hire a CTO (or become one), be clear:
- What does this role actually involve?
- What decisions will they own?
- Who reports to them?
- What's the success metric?
- When does this role evolve?

The best CTOs evolve with the company. They know that what worked at stage 1 won't work at stage 5.

## The Stages of CTO Evolution

Most CTOs at successful startups follow this trajectory:

**Stage 1: Builder** (Pre-product to MVP)
- "I build the thing"
- Role: Code-focused, architectural decisions

**Stage 2: Leader** (PMF to Growth)
- "I build the team and the thing"
- Role: Balanced between code and leadership

**Stage 3: Strategist** (Growth to Scale)
- "I lead the team and align with business"
- Role: People and strategy focused

**Stage 4: Executive** (Scale and beyond)
- "I represent technology to the business"
- Role: C-suite strategic leadership

Some CTOs thrive at stage 1 but struggle at stage 3. Some people love stage 2 and don't want to go further. Both are fine—you just need to know what stage you're at and who's right for that stage.

## Finding the Right CTO for Your Stage

**Pre-product:** Someone technical who wants to build. Doesn't need management experience.

**PMF to Growth:** Someone technical who enjoys mentorship and leadership. Should have managed engineers before.

**Scale:** Someone with C-suite and large team experience. Should have managed multiple teams.

**At each transition:** You might need a different CTO. That's ok. Not everyone wants to lead 50 engineers.

## The Bottom Line

The CTO job isn't fixed. It evolves with your company.

At pre-product, it's almost 100% engineering. At scale, it's almost 100% strategy and leadership.

The best CTOs understand this and adapt. The worst ones try to do the pre-product job at a 50-person company (micromanaging code) or the scale job at an early startup (over-strategizing when speed matters).

Know your stage. Know what CTO means for that stage. Hire someone who's good at that stage.

And be prepared: whoever's right today might not be right in two years. Plan for that.
