### Acting and Iterating on Ideas

Most development teams are inefficient due to overthinking and fear of action. Perfection can come laterâ€”progress is what keeps you alive. Quick iteration is crucial, especially in startup environments.

**Core Strategies:**

* **Take Action Quickly:** Don't get stuck in endless debates about the "perfect" solution. Do a quick assessment of options, integrate a solution for a small part of your project, and set time limits for research and decision-making (e.g., 2 hours).

* **Embrace Iteration:** Be prepared to change solutions if they're not working. Don't fall victim to sunk cost fallacy. Learn from each attempt and improve continuously.

* **Practical Decision-Making:** Use AI tools like Claude or Grok to help evaluate options. Define clear goals before starting, create tight feedback loops, and regularly reflect on progress.

**Example:** Implementing Supabase as a database framework quickly, knowing it might not be the long-term solution. The key was solving an immediate need and being willing to adapt later.

Progress beats perfection. Focus on moving forward and refining as you go.
