### Simple Automation Workflows

Workflows are the routines and systems you use to get things done. They define what you do and when you do it. Refining and improving them is key to growing your business and a great way to do that is through automation. After all, things that happen automatically are cheap and quick. Automating your workflows can therefore massively improve business outcomes, giving you an edge over the competition.

Workflow automation is the process of setting up an automated system to perform tasks that you would otherwise do manually. For comprehensive guidance, see our [Business Process Automation Guide](/blog/posts/2025-06-22-business-process-automation-small-business-guide/). You need to set up a system that can carry out every required task, in the right order, at the correct time.

**Key Components of Workflow Automation:**

* **Triggers:** Triggers define when things happen. A trigger may be the receipt of an email, or the changed status of a ticket. You can also schedule triggers for particular times, or at regular intervals.
* **Actions:** Actions are the things your system does. They could involve copying something from A to B, running a software script, or sending someone a message.
* **Logic and Rules:** Workflow automation involves making decisions, and then taking action accordingly. Decisions are based on rules, defined by logical steps.
* **Monitoring and Analysis:** Many workflow automation systems track what they do using metrics. Systems can log the actions they take and report them to administrators.
