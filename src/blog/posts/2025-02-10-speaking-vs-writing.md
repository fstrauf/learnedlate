### Speaking > Writing

Speaking is approximately 3x faster than typing when communicating with AI. Context is crucial when interacting with AI systems, and speech-to-text tools have significantly improved to make this practical.

Typing prompts is slow and prone to errors. Speaking allows for more natural and faster communication, letting you provide more comprehensive context to AI systems.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Speed:** Text entry speeds using speech are about 3.0 times faster than keyboard for English
* **Natural Flow:** Speaking allows for more natural communication patterns
* **Rich Context:** Easier to provide detailed context when speaking vs typing

**Practical Tools:**

* **Superwhisper:** Dedicated Mac app for speech-to-text
* **Mac Dictation:** Built-in dictation feature with hotkey configuration
* **AI Client Tools:** Native dictation in AI applications

Configure a hotkey for quick dictation in text editors to maximize efficiency. While speech-to-text isn't perfect and some words may not be detected accurately, the speed gains make it worthwhile for AI interactions.
