### Automate Marketing, Automate Anything

You can automate marketing and other complex tasks by creating your own personal AI agent. This is done by connecting an AI like Claude to external applications and services using extensions, which allows the AI to perform powerful, automated workflows. For broader automation context, see our [Business Process Automation Guide](/blog/posts/2025-06-22-business-process-automation-small-business-guide/).

An AI agent is the combination of an AI, extensions (or MCPs), and a structured, step-by-step workflow. Here are a couple of examples of what you can do with it:

**Automated SEO Research**

Instead of manually searching for keywords, you can create a workflow where the AI:

1.  Connects to a service like Ahrefs to programmatically analyze data.
2.  Identifies optimal keywords with high search volume and low difficulty.
3.  Analyzes existing content to find gaps and generate content briefs.

**Automated Social Media Promotion**

Create a workflow where you give the AI a link to a published blog post. The AI will then:

1.  Fetch the article's content and images.
2.  Generate promotional social media posts tailored for different platforms.
3.  Save the posts for you to review and publish.

By combining an AI with extensions and structured processes, you can create a personal AI agent to automate a wide range of tasks.
