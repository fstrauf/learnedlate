You're about to give someone $50,000 to $500,000 to build something critical to your business. The stakes are high, and most founders do this backwards—they pick a company because they seem nice or because a friend recommended them, then hope it works out.

It doesn't usually work out. Not because developers are bad, but because founders don't know how to evaluate them.

This guide walks you through exactly what to look for—and more importantly, what red flags mean "keep looking."

## Before You Talk to Anyone

You need to get clear on what you actually need.

Most founders come to developers with vague requirements like "build me an app" or "create a platform." That's guaranteed to fail. Developers can't read minds, scope blows up, costs spiral, and everyone's frustrated.

Before you talk to developers, know this:

- **What problem does this software solve?** (Be specific. Not "improve efficiency"—"reduce invoice processing time from 3 hours to 30 minutes")
- **Who will use it?** (Your team, customers, internal staff, etc.)
- **What's the success metric?** (How will you know it worked?)
- **What's your timeline?** (Months, weeks, when-it's-done?)
- **What's your budget range?** (Ballpark, not exact. Developers need context.)
- **What's your risk tolerance?** (Can you launch with 70% of features or do you need 95%?)

Write these down. A developer who asks these questions before quoting you is immediately more credible than one who quotes you after a 15-minute call.

## The Types of Development Resources

Know what you're evaluating before you start evaluating.

**Freelancers (1-2 people):**
- Upside: Flexible, often cheaper per hour, personal attention
- Downside: Limited bandwidth, will disappear if they get a full-time job, riskier for complex projects
- Best for: Simple projects, $5K-$30K range, when you don't need ongoing support

**Development Agencies (5-50+ people):**
- Upside: Established process, multiple team members so knowledge isn't siloed, usually have project management structure
- Downside: More expensive, potentially slower, may feel like you're a small fish to them
- Best for: Complex projects, $50K+, when you need reliability and ongoing support

**Offshore/Nearshore Teams (Usually larger than freelancers):**
- Upside: Often cheaper, large capacity, can work around the clock
- Downside: Communication complexity, timezone challenges, quality varies significantly, harder to iterate quickly
- Best for: Specific, well-defined projects with clear requirements (not exploratory work)

**Hybrid: Your own team + outsourced partners:**
- Upside: You control strategy, outsource execution, maintain knowledge internally
- Downside: Requires management overhead from you, more communication coordination
- Best for: Growing startups, ongoing development, when you want long-term relationships

## The Vetting Process: Step by Step

### Step 1: Filter by Track Record

Not "how long they've been around" but "can they show me they've done work like mine?"

**Ask for and review:**
- **Case studies or portfolio:** Do they have 3+ examples of similar projects? Do they work in your industry?
- **References:** Ask for 3 past clients and actually call them. Ask: "Would you hire them again? What was harder than expected? Did they deliver on time and budget?"
- **Technology stack:** Are they using modern, maintainable technology or ancient stuff?
- **Documentation:** When you look at their previous work, can you understand the codebase? (This matters if you need to hire someone else later)

**Red flags:**
- "We don't share our portfolio with potential clients" (If they can't show you work, they probably don't have work worth showing)
- References are only on their website (Actually call people, even if they provide numbers)
- All their projects are 5+ years old (Technology moves fast; outdated examples suggest outdated practices)
- They use outdated tech stacks (Python 2, ancient jQuery, etc.)

### Step 2: Assess Communication

This is underrated. A great developer who communicates poorly will cost you thousands in misunderstandings.

**How to evaluate:**
- **Initial response time:** How long do they take to reply? Fast isn't always better, but ignored emails are bad.
- **Question quality:** Do they ask smart questions about your problem? (See "the vetting process" section above—they should ask questions before quoting.)
- **Clarity of explanations:** When they discuss technical stuff, can you understand it? Or are they using jargon to hide the fact that they're not explaining clearly?
- **Project communication plan:** Do they have a clear plan for updates, meetings, and how you'll track progress?

**Test drive their communication:**
- Share your requirements document and see what questions they ask back
- Ask a technical question and see how they explain it
- Ask about a past project delay and see if they own it or blame the client

**Red flags:**
- They don't ask questions; they just quote immediately (They don't understand your problem)
- They're dismissive of your non-technical concerns ("That's not my job")
- They only communicate via email, no video calls or phone (When issues come up, email is slow)
- They don't return emails reliably (If they're disorganized now, they'll be disorganized during your project)

### Step 3: Assess Technical Depth

You don't need to be a programmer to evaluate whether a developer actually knows their stuff.

**Questions to ask:**
- **"Walk me through how you'd approach building [specific feature in your project].** What are the decisions you'd make?" (Good developers think through multiple approaches and trade-offs; mediocre ones have a "one size fits all" solution)
- **"What challenges do you foresee in our project?"** (Good developers spot risks; mediocre ones are overly optimistic)
- **"Show me some code you've written."** (Not to judge it deeply, but to see if you can read it and understand it; if it's totally incomprehensible, that's a bad sign)
- **"How do you handle scope creep?"** (Do they have a process for managing change requests? Or will they just add things and bill you more?)
- **"How do you ensure quality?"** (Testing, code review, staging environments? Or "we ship it and fix bugs later"?)

**Red flags:**
- They guarantee the project will be "done on time and on budget" (Anyone who guarantees this hasn't built software before; unknowns always exist)
- They're evasive about technical details (Good developers love talking about tech; evasiveness suggests they're hiding something)
- They don't ask about your hosting, infrastructure, or deployment (These matter; if they don't care, they're treating this as code-writing, not software engineering)

### Step 4: Evaluate Team Stability and Knowledge

Where will knowledge live after the project?

**Ask:**
- **"Who specifically will be working on my project?"** (Make sure it's not "whoever is available"; you want continuity)
- **"What happens if a team member leaves mid-project?"** (Do they have backup? Documentation? Or does everything stop?)
- **"How do you document code?"** (Will the next person—or you—be able to understand what they built?)
- **"Will I have access to the code and documentation?"** (You should own the deliverables, not just rent the software)

**Red flags:**
- The senior developer quoted your project but won't be doing the work (Bait and switch)
- They can't tell you who specifically will be on your project
- They don't document code (Technical debt guaranteed)
- You won't own the codebase (You're renting, not building)

### Step 5: Understand How They Handle Problems

This is where they'll show you who they really are.

**Ask:**
- **"Tell me about a project that went over budget or timeline. What happened and how did you handle it?"** (Everyone has these; how they handled it matters. Did they own it? Blame the client? Learn from it?)
- **"How do you handle scope creep?"** (Do they have a process for saying "that's out of scope"? Or do they let clients pile on undefined work?)
- **"What's your testing and QA process?"** (Code reviews, automated testing, staging environments? Or "we ship and fix bugs as they come up"?)
- **"How do you handle post-launch support?"** (What happens on day 1 after launch when there's a bug? Do they own it or is it now your problem?)

**Red flags:**
- They blame all their project failures on clients ("Clients always change their minds")
- They have no post-launch support plan (Someone needs to own production issues)
- They don't do code reviews (The risk of bad code going live is high)

### Step 6: Check the Contract

Don't let a great conversation mask a bad contract.

**Essentials to have in writing:**
- **Scope:** What's included, what's not, what happens if scope changes
- **Timeline:** Start date, milestones, completion date (with definition of "complete")
- **Payment terms:** How much, when (usually tied to milestones), what happens if work is incomplete
- **Intellectual property:** Who owns the code? (It should be you)
- **Warranty/support:** If something breaks in the first 30 days, who fixes it?
- **Termination clause:** What happens if the project is going badly and you need to exit? (This shouldn't be punitive if they're the problem)
- **Communication and escalation:** How often do you connect? Who's the point person?

**Red flags:**
- They won't put terms in writing ("Let's figure it out as we go")
- They own the code and you're licensing it (You should own it)
- No milestones or interim deliverables (You need checkpoints)
- Vague definition of what "done" means

## The Interview Scorecard

Use this to compare candidates objectively.

| Factor | Weight | Freelancer A | Freelancer B | Agency C |
|--------|--------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Track record (case studies + refs) | 20% | 7/10 | 8/10 | 9/10 |
| Communication clarity | 20% | 6/10 | 9/10 | 8/10 |
| Technical depth | 20% | 8/10 | 7/10 | 9/10 |
| Team stability | 15% | 4/10 | 3/10 | 9/10 |
| Problem-solving history | 15% | 7/10 | 8/10 | 8/10 |
| Contract clarity | 10% | 5/10 | 8/10 | 9/10 |
| **TOTAL (out of 10)** | 100% | **6.7** | **7.3** | **8.6** |

Use this framework but weight it based on your actual priorities. If team stability matters most for your project, increase that weight.

## Red Flags That Mean "Walk Away"

- They pressure you to decide quickly ("We can only hold this spot for 48 hours")
- They're evasive about budget or timeline ("It depends; could be $50K or $500K")
- They don't ask about your problem; they just start talking about their solution
- They've never done anything like your project before
- They won't give you references
- They can't explain why their approach is the right one
- You don't understand what they're saying and they don't help clarify
- They don't have a clear process for managing scope or handling changes
- They won't put the contract in writing
- They own the code, not you

**Any of these? Keep looking.**

## The Green Flags

- They ask more questions than they answer, initially
- They can explain complex concepts simply
- They provide 3+ references and those references actually call back
- They have relevant case studies and walk you through one in detail
- They're honest about constraints ("We'd need to investigate that more; here's how we'd do it")
- They have a clear change management process
- They're excited about your problem, not just excited about the paycheck
- They push back on bad ideas ("We could do that, but here's why it would be a bad idea")
- They own problems that come up
- They treat the contract as a partnership framework, not a liability protection

## After You Choose: Setting Yourself Up for Success

Once you've hired someone, these things matter:

- **Be clear and available:** Vague requirements are the #1 cause of project failure. If you're unclear, your developers will guess. Your guesses were different from their guesses.
- **Communicate frequently:** Weekly check-ins minimum. Daily if you're doing rapid iteration.
- **Stick to your scope:** Every change request costs time and money. If something is must-have, something else must be cut.
- **Pay on time:** Developers do their best work for people who pay reliably.
- **Trust their expertise but ask questions:** If they recommend something, ask why. Don't micromanage the code, but do manage the outcomes.

## The Bottom Line

Choosing the right development company or freelancer isn't about finding the cheapest or the flashiest.

It's about finding someone who:
1. **Understands your problem** (and asks good questions)
2. **Has a proven track record** (with work and references you can verify)
3. **Communicates clearly** (you should understand what's happening)
4. **Has a process** (for managing scope, quality, and change)
5. **Owns problems** (when something goes wrong, they figure it out)

The vetting process takes time—2-4 weeks if you do it right. That's worth it. Hiring the wrong developer and realizing it 3 months into the project will cost you far more than the time you spend evaluating now.
