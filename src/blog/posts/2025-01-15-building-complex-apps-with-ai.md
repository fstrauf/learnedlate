### Building Complex Apps With AI

Many people believe AI is only useful for simple "vibe coding" projects, not complex applications. This is wrong. You can build sophisticated apps with AI using the right approach.

The key is mastering four proven strategies: solid rules and context, scoping tasks, modularization, and comprehensive testing.

**Essential Strategies:**

* **Solid Rules and Context:** Provide extremely clear, specific instructions to AI. Include screenshots, logs, and references when describing projects.
* **Task Scoping:** Break down projects into smaller, manageable components. Create detailed task lists and requirements.
* **Modularization:** Structure code in modules to improve maintainability and make it easier for AI to understand and modify.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement automated testing to catch potential issues and ensure code quality.

The future of development will involve people being skilled at "telling AI what to code." While in theory, everyone can be a developer, right now you still need to be quite good at giving the right instructions.
