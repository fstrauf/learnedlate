You need technical leadership. But you're not sure what form it should take.

A full-time CTO is expensive and locks you in. A fractional CTO is cheaper but might not have enough bandwidth. An advisor is lightweight but might not be committed. Each has trade-offs.

The right answer depends on your stage, budget, and what problems you're trying to solve.

## The Three Models

### Model 1: Full-Time CTO

**What it is:** Someone on your team full-time, building and leading your engineering.

**When it makes sense:**
- You have 20+ team members
- You're raising significant capital (Series B+)
- Your product roadmap is clear and complex
- You need someone making daily product decisions
- You can afford $200k-400k+ salary + equity

**Advantages:**
- Full commitment (they're thinking about your business 40+ hours/week)
- Deep knowledge of your codebase and team
- Authority to make architectural decisions
- Can mentor engineers as you hire
- Represents you with investors and partners

**Disadvantages:**
- Expensive (salary, benefits, equity)
- Locked in for 3-4 years
- Hard to replace if it doesn't work out
- Takes time to ramp (first 2 months = low productivity)
- If wrong person, their mistakes scale across your company

**Red flags to watch:**
- CTO wants to rewrite everything from scratch
- CTO isn't mentoring junior engineers
- CTO avoids hiring other strong engineers (threatens them)
- Team morale drops after CTO joins

### Model 2: Fractional CTO

**What it is:** Someone who works part-time (20-30 hours/week) on your specific problems.

**When it makes sense:**
- You're pre-Series A or early Series A
- You have 5-20 engineers or are building to that scale
- You need technical leadership but not full-time
- You can afford $10k-30k/month
- You know roughly what you need to build

**Advantages:**
- More affordable than full-time ($120k-360k annually vs $200k-400k)
- Flexible: can reduce/increase hours based on needs
- Often brings experience from other startups
- Can onboard and exit cleanly
- Still substantial commitment (way more than a few hours of consulting)

**Disadvantages:**
- Split attention (they have other clients too)
- Might not be available during emergencies
- Less deep knowledge of your specific codebase
- Can't mentor engineers as extensively
- Need clarity on what "fractional" actually means

**Red flags to watch:**
- Fractional CTO is also fractional CTO for your direct competitors
- Unclear hours or availability
- Treats it like consulting (minimal commitment)
- Isn't available for your emergencies

### Model 3: CTO Advisor

**What it is:** Someone you talk to occasionally (1-5 hours/month) who gives advice but doesn't work on your product.

**When it makes sense:**
- You have an experienced technical founder or lead engineer
- You need outside perspective, not hands-on building
- You can afford $2k-5k/month
- Your technical strategy is mostly figured out; you just need review
- You want to learn from someone more experienced

**Advantages:**
- Cheap ($24k-60k annually)
- Low commitment (you're not locked in)
- Experienced perspective
- Great for tactical advice
- Easy to bring on and off

**Disadvantages:**
- Very limited time commitment
- Not involved enough to catch big problems early
- Can't execute anything themselves
- Often feel disconnected from your business
- Risk of generic advice that doesn't apply to your situation

**Red flags to watch:**
- Advisor never actually shows up
- Advice is generic ("you should document your code")
- Advisor doesn't understand your business model
- Relationship is one-way (they talk, you listen, nothing changes)

## How to Choose: The Decision Framework

Use these factors to decide which model is right for you.

### Factor 1: Your Complexity

**High complexity** (complex product, scaling, system design challenges)
→ Full-time CTO or fractional CTO

**Medium complexity** (clear product, growing team, occasional big questions)
→ Fractional CTO or advisor

**Low complexity** (simple product, small team, mostly execution)
→ Advisor or someone on your team

### Factor 2: Your Stage

**Pre-seed to seed** ($0-1M raised, <10 people)
→ Usually: CTO advisor or co-founder who's technical

**Seed to Series A** ($1-5M raised, 10-30 people)
→ Usually: Fractional CTO (brings expertise without full-time cost)

**Series A to Series B** ($5-20M raised, 30-100 people)
→ Usually: Fractional CTO transitioning to full-time CTO

**Series B+** ($20M+ raised, 100+ people)
→ Usually: Full-time CTO (multiple engineering leaders)

### Factor 3: Your Budget

**<$100k/year for external help**
→ Advisor or very part-time fractional

**$100-300k/year**
→ Fractional CTO (20-30 hours/week)

**$200k-400k+/year**
→ Full-time CTO

**$300k+/year**
→ Full-time CTO + potentially fractional CTO for specific expertise

### Factor 4: Your Engineering Depth

**You have strong engineers on your team**
→ Advisor or fractional CTO (your team can execute, they provide direction)

**You have some engineers but no clear technical leader**
→ Fractional CTO (needs to lead but doesn't need to write much code)

**You have no experienced engineers**
→ Full-time CTO (needs to hire and build the team)

**You are the only technical person**
→ Full-time CTO or substantial fractional CTO (this is basically full-time anyway)

## The Evaluation Checklist

When you're interviewing potential CTOs (any model), evaluate:

**Technical Depth:**
- Can they articulate the technical challenges in your specific domain?
- Have they solved similar problems before?
- Can they explain technical concepts clearly?

**Team Building:**
- Have they built engineering teams before?
- Can they attract and retain good engineers?
- Do they push you to hire smartly rather than quickly?

**Business Understanding:**
- Do they understand your business model?
- Can they connect technical decisions to business outcomes?
- Do they push back on "shiny feature" requests that don't matter?

**Communication:**
- Can they explain technical concepts to non-technical people?
- Are they transparent about problems and risks?
- Do they listen or just lecture?

**Character:**
- Can you trust them?
- Will they own problems or make excuses?
- Do they take feedback?

## The Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Hiring full-time CTO too early**
- If you're pre-Series A with <$2M raised, a full-time CTO is often overkill
- Better to use fractional CTO and spend money on engineers
- Upgrade to full-time when you have the budget

**Mistake 2: Hiring fractional CTO with no clear problems to solve**
- "We need a CTO" isn't a problem
- You need a CTO to solve specific problems: scaling, architecture decisions, hiring strategy
- Be clear on what you need

**Mistake 3: Picking based on resume, not fit**
- "CTO at Google" doesn't mean they'll be a good CTO for your startup
- Biggest companies have different constraints than startups
- Look for people who understand startups and change

**Mistake 4: Not being clear about what the role actually is**
- "Fractional CTO" can mean 30 hours/week or 3 hours/week
- "CTO advisor" can mean strategic guidance or hands-on help
- Get specific about hours, scope, and deliverables

**Mistake 5: Hiring without a trial period**
- Don't commit to 2 years
- Try 3 months first (renewable)
- See if it actually works before locking in

## The Conversation to Have

Before committing, have this conversation:

**1. "What specific problems are we trying to solve?"**
- Be clear about what you need help with
- Is it architecture? Scaling? Hiring? Culture?
- If you can't articulate it, you're not ready for a CTO yet

**2. "How would you approach our situation?"**
- What's your first 90 days?
- What would you audit?
- What would you change?
- This reveals whether they understand your business

**3. "How do you stay current with technology?"**
- Changing tech landscape means continuous learning
- How do they keep up?
- Do they experiment or just use proven tools?

**4. "How do you measure success?"**
- What does good look like?
- Are you measuring by code quality? Speed? Team culture? Product outcomes?
- This aligns expectations

**5. "What's your commitment level?"**
- For fractional: how many hours? When are you available? What's your emergency response time?
- For advisor: how often do we talk? What's the scope?
- Get specific

**6. "What happens if this doesn't work out?"**
- How long is the commitment?
- What's the exit process?
- No surprises later

## The Bottom Line

Choosing the right technical leadership matters because:
- **Early stage (<Series A):** Pick fractional CTO if you need external help
- **Growth stage (Series A-B):** Pick fractional CTO with potential to become full-time
- **Scale stage (Series B+):** Pick full-time CTO

But the model matters less than the person. A fractional CTO who actually cares beats a full-time CTO who doesn't.

The decision tree:
1. **What specific problem do you need to solve?** (Or are you just copying what other startups do?)
2. **What's your budget?** (This might be the limiting factor)
3. **What's your stage and complexity?** (Determines how much help you need)
4. **Who's the right person?** (Model is secondary to fit)

Get these right and the model choice becomes obvious.
